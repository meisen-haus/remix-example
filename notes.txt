- distributed tracing using MetaHelper
- issues related to this method when Remix does "soft navigation"
- root.tsx configured incorrectly - need to export the root wrapped with withSentry
- Replays will never show the initial http.server transaction in the trace view because this transaction cannot have a replayID (session replay is not active)
